## Outcomes

__In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?__

- [x] Ability for mentors/students to sign up
- [x] Breakdown of all the different schools for students
- [x] Chat feature for students/mentors (Using JavaScript)
- [x] Profile for mentors
- ~~Main public feed that shows successful mentored students~~ 
  - (Switched to have the main feed be newly added programs)

__In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?__

- ~~Calendar integration so mentors and students can set up times to talk~~
  - Upon further investiagtion, the "Date Input" html attribute is not universally supported by browsers (like Safari) so I decided to remove this feature. 
- [ ] Better CSS to make the site more friendly and modern (this is a weak point for me as I am not very good at designing User Interfaces)

__In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?__

 I plan to start things off simply. I want to get the User Signup for Students and mentors set. Then I will create the ability for mentors to add Schools and subsequent programs at those schools. These will be visible to students. 

After that, I will add the mentor profiles which will allow me to set up a review process for the mentors so that after the student's connect, they can review said mentor. Once the profile is setup, I will then allow the student to actually contact a mentor for a particular school/program. This is when I will integrate the text based chat for the student/mentor. 

The "relationship" between the student and mentor will have three states: in progress, ended-bad, and ended-good. Ended-good state relationships will show up on the main public feed that is visible without signing in along with a required student testimonial. 

I think the biggest thing I will need to focus on is the user interfaces. I am not very good at (and truthfully not very passionate about) making the interfaces all pretty and refined so I am going to have to push myself to make it so this App does not look bland and boring.
